- panning and zooming
  - panning does work `scroller: { enabled: true; pannable: true}` but it interferes with selecting.
    The best would be a scroll / select mode \
    Modifiers (panning would only work with that modifier) would work too
    but I didn't manage to get the cursor working (the cursor is "grab"
    all the time)
  - zooming doesn't work out of the box, this should be manual (zoom in / zoom out buttons)
